## Overview

App downloads videos and then uploads them to Supervisely Storage. Video file has to be in Supervisely's internal storage to provide fast processing speed during labeling.

## How To Use

1. Create new team on `source` instance. Copy project to this team. Let's call this project: `project_to_share`.
2. Create and invite user to this team. This new User has access only to projects in special team, all data in other teams is private.
3. Share `id` of `project_to_share` and user's `api_token` with your labeling provider.
4. Labeling provider has to run app and in modal window define `SERVER_ADDRESS`, `id` of project that should be copied and `API_TOKEN`.
